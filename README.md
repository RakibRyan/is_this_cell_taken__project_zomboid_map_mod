Is this cell taken project zomboid map mod


Do you want to make the biggest map possible in the world of project zomboid but not sure which mods can you use/ which map mods overwrite others?
Did you start making a map only to find that someone else already made a map for that cell; as a reasult your map is forgotten by the community?

This mod will help you find out if a cell already has a map mod on it or not.


It's easier to just find the mods folder (the id in the URL) and open it, go mods > Over the River - Secondary Route > media > maps > Over The River Secondary Route and just look at the numbers on the lotheader files.

## Future???
