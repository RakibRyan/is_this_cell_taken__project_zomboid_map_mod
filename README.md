# Is this cell taken - project zomboid map mod


• Do you want to make the biggest map possible in the world of project zomboid but not sure which mods can you use/ which map mods overwrite others?

• Did you start making a map only to find that someone else already made a map for that cell; as a reasult your map is forgotten by the community?

• Do you just want to get an overall idea of pz map with mods enabled?
This mod will help you find out if a cell already has a map mod on it or not.




## Future

• Add support when hovered over the cell it shows the map that occupy that cell.

• Make a gui for coordinates

• A gui for maps listed

• A gui for adding new maps , coordinates and steam link

• Support for importing coordinates and map names from a txt/ java file

• Add steam link to all the maps

• Auto subscribe all selected maps

• A gui for auto subscribe

• actual tiled map for all of them so people who prefer can see the maps

• Searchable maps

• Polishing: a line with map name and highlighting

• web build (currently not possible for godot bug)

• Auto conflict finder

• Auto conflict gui
