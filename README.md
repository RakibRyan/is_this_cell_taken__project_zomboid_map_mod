Is this cell taken project zomboid map mod


Do you want to make the biggest map possible in the world of project zomboid but not sure which mods can you use/ which map mods overwrite others?
Did you start making a map only to find that someone else already made a map for that cell; as a reasult your map is forgotten by the community?

This mod will help you find out if a cell already has a map mod on it or not.
