# Is this cell taken - project zomboid map mod


• Do you want to make the biggest map possible in the world of project zomboid but not sure which mods can you use/ which map mods overwrite others?

• Did you start making a map only to find that someone else already made a map for that cell; as a reasult your map is forgotten by the community?

This mod will help you find out if a cell already has a map mod on it or not.


It's easier to just find the mods folder (the id in the URL) and open it, go mods > Over the River - Secondary Route > media > maps > Over The River Secondary Route and just look at the numbers on the lotheader files.

## Future???

• Add support when hovered over the cell it shows cell location and maps that occupy that cell.

• Add more maps

• Make a gui for coordinates

• A gui for maps listed

• A gui for adding new maps , coordinates and steam link

• Support for importing coordinates and map names from a txt/ java file

• Add steam link to all the maps

• Auto subscribe all selected maps

• A gui for auto subscribe

• Top down maps for all of them so people who prefer can see the maps

• Searchable maps

• Polishing: a line with map name and highlighting

• web extension

• Auto conflict finder

• Auto conflict gui


## work in progress

implement above features???

it is getting tedious. I really need a system that can read/write map data to a text file. For example

"map 1" =  (4,3),(1,5),(2,6),(3,5),(2,4),(1,0),(-5,8),(-9,-9)
"map 2" =  (-4,3),(1,-5),(2,2),(3,-5),(2,7),(1,5),(-4,8),(-3,-9),(-9,-9),(0,0)


## Version 0.5.7 Date: 22/1/2023 Total:173

• added 12 new maps 

## Version 0.5.6 Date: 24/09/2023

• added 2 new maps 

• learned about signals and got the basic hover working.

## Version 0.5.5 Date: 20/09/2023

• Got the zoom and panning working, cell coordinates display accurately aswell. Apparently it was mapping a local position. 

## Version 0.5.4 Date: 20/09/2023
 
• Got the zoom and panning working however when dragging the map to another location it changes the cell location too.

## Version 0.5.3 Date: 19/09/2023 

• Yay, it works. just needed to put it on canvas layer.

## Version 0.5.2 Date: 19/09/2023 

• Learned to reference scripts. It's way easier that unity. coordinate now a child of camera2d but the bug still remains. 

## Version 0.5.1 Date: 19/09/2023 

• Got the basic zoom feature working.  

• Has a bug. The cell number is attached to the world. with the current setup making it as a child of camera2d causes error.

• Coordinates gui string formatting

• Added all the map mods Total 161 maps, for build 41 till date 18/09/2023 with only a few exception which were impossible to determine the cell coordinate.
