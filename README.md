# Is_this_cell_taken__project_zomboid_map_mod
Is this cell taken project zomboid map mod


• Do you want to make the biggest map possible in the world of project zomboid but not sure which mods can you use/ which map mods overwrite others?

• Did you start making a map only to find that someone else already made a map for that cell; as a reasult your map is forgotten by the community?

This mod will help you find out if a cell already has a map mod on it or not.


It's easier to just find the mods folder (the id in the URL) and open it, go mods > Over the River - Secondary Route > media > maps > Over The River Secondary Route and just look at the numbers on the lotheader files.

## Future???

• Add support when hovered over the cell it shows cell location and maps that occupy that cell.

• Add more maps

• Make a gui for coordinates

• A gui for maps listed

• A gui for adding new maps , coordinates and steam link

• Support for importing coordinates and map names from a txt/ java file

• Add steam link to all the maps

• Auto subscribe all selected maps

• A gui for auto subscribe

• Top down maps for all of them so people who prefer can see the maps

• Searchable maps

• Polishing: a line with map name and highlighting

• web extension

• Auto conflict finder

• Auto conflict gui
