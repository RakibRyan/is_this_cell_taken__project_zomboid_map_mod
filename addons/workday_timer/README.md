Workday Timer is a Godot 4 addon that adds a timer to the editor. Perfect for when you're trying to spend a set amount of time on your game a day.

The timer can be started, paused, and resumed from the button next to it. You can also reset the timer and change the amout of time the timer counts down from with the settings icon.

When you set a time, it is saved and will be retrieved when the addon is loaded. Additionally, when Godot is closed, the amount of time remaining is also saved so you won't lose your place.
